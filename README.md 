# CPU Simulator

## Overview
This project simulates a simple CPU that can execute basic arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB) and memory operations (LOAD, STORE) over multiple cycles.

## Features
- Multi-cycle execution: fetch, decode, execute, memory access, write-back.
- Supports basic arithmetic operations and memory access.
- Real-time visualization of the CPU's state (registers and memory).

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project.
2. Ensure `program.txt` and `registers.txt` are populated with the required instructions and register values.
3. Run the `cpu.py` script.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` for visualization (`pip install matplotlib`)

## How to Extend
- Add more operations to the ALU.
- Implement branching logic.
- Improve memory management with different types of memory (caches, etc.).
